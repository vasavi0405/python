They had noted that the resort facilities are fantastic for families.  With that in mind, we booked a standard Royal Suite via the Mulia's website, which included a promotion for staying 7, but paying 5 days, with complementary daily breakfast for two.  The hotel thankfully offers an airport transfer option, which we used.  Arriving at night time with two young children in tow, we were very tired, but the transfer staff were very helpful with taking our bags and making sure we were sufficiently cooled and hydrated for the quick 20ish minute ride from the airport to the resort.  The check-in experience was quick and seamless, and we were escorted to our room with some additional information being provided about where things are located on the resort.  The hotel wifi was stable, if not not particularly super fast, within interior spaces.  However, outside reception is very patchy, and I found that I would lose the signal constantly.  However, the outdoor spaces were fabulous enough for me to be happy to put down my phone.We were situated in Room 2341, which is essentially at the back of the property. This location is fantastic for beach and pool access, but is a considerable distance from the resort facilities such as the lobby, and dining precinct.  Please keep this in mind if you are travelling with children.  I cannot stress enough how large this property is - it is much more akin to a small city than a resort.  It will take a few days to fully find your way around if you wish to explore.  The Mulia Resort accommodation area contains a beautifully kept outdoor garden in the middle of the building, and also has a myriad of water features.  One thing my wife mentioned was how meticulously kept the gardens throughout the property were.The Royal Suite is magnificently spacious - the pictures on the website do not give adequate justice to just how large the room is, as well as how sun-filled the room is when the curtains are drawn.  The bed was large, with oversized pillows, and was incredibly comfortable.  The room was also set up with a sofa bed for our eldest child, and a portable cot in the room, as per our request.  I must give special mention to the walk in wardrobe, which was large enough to accommodate all our luggage and clothing.  The bathroom is very luxurious, with an oversized soaking tub that fills up very quickly, and a fantastic Toto electronic toilet, which I have not seen in any hotel outside of Japan.  The amenities were good, with particular mention going to the shower gel from Mandarin Tea.  Despite all of us being in the one room, it never felt crowded at all, and the airconditioning kept us very comfortable, despite the unseasonable heat.  The Samsung Smart TV has, in my opinion, the best selection of channels I have ever seen in a hotel.  This could be dangerous, as the temptation to just stay in bed and watch tv while ordering room service is just too high!  The room attendants were fantastic, with exceptionally quick turnarounds on housekeeping services.  We often had the room on do not disturb during primary housekeeping hours, but in the span of a quick meal outside, housekeeping always had the room looking absolutely faultless.  There was also a large workdesk, which was more than enough to enjoy in room dining on.  The only minor issue I would note is that the hotel rightfully expects wet clothing not to be draped on the balcony - however, the outdoor clothing rack does not provide sufficient space for more than two adult's worth of wet clothing.  That being said, the high humidity and temperatures meant that clothing dried within a few hours at most.  The hotel is located on the southern end of the island, along Geger Beach (which is along the eastern side).  The Beach was great, with fine sand and warm water.  Just note that the sand closer to the resort side (south) is slightly rocky, but the sand towards the Mulia side (north) is much softer.  The hotel maintains countless cabanas poolside, as well as the beach, so you can certainly spend many hours going between the two areas.  The pool attendants and lifeguards are more than happy enough to set up the cabanas for you.  The beach looks out to the Pura Geger Dalem Pemutih, which has to be one of the most breathtaking locations for a temple I have ever seen.  Based on our research, there was plenty of tourist attractions to see along the beach, which thankfully has a walking path, but the pull of the hotel was too good, and we did not end up venturing off the property.  The staff were wonderful, friendly, and polite.  From housekeeping, through to the dining servers, lifeguards/pool attendants, reception, maintenance crew, as well as gardeners, everyone (and I mean everyone) we saw greeted us with a smile. Our 4 year old even commented that \\\"everyone here is so nice\\\".  I must give special mention to the staff of Mulia Kidz, who treated our eldest daughter like a Balinese princess, and made sure that she was always occupied and entertained.  Our daughter is usually not receptive to 'strangers', but they put her at ease to the point where she even demanded that we leave her there on a daily basis, which speaks volumes to their ability to make the children feel comfortable and safe.  A recurring theme in this review is that the resort is large - and there is a small army of staff.  For those who prefer a more personalised experience with a familiar face day to day, you may be better off getting a room type with a butler.  I wish I could remember the names of all the people who helped us, but the reality is that it would be a very long list.Our 7-day stay was in early November, which I understand is off-peak season.  I'm not sure what the occupancy rate was, but we hardly saw anyone anywhere towards the start of our stay.  However, we gradually saw more people towards the end of it, with more guests and group arrivals coming in then.  As mentioned earlier, the resort is enormous, so outside of breakfast time, we saw only a handful of people anywhere else at a given time, including the pools.  There are plenty of activities scheduled throughout the resort grounds, as well as within the relevant kid's clubs.  While other kid friendly destinations can be chaotic, the resort was very tranquil and quiet.We would typically have breakfast at about 9-9.30, where it started to become busy towards the end of our trip.  However, the staff at the Cafe (which can be described as the main dining venue), were fantastic at making sure empty tables were turned around quickly.  We never waited for more than 1 minute prior to being seated.  The Cafe specialises in International cuisine, and we were impressed by the mix of Balinese/Indonesian, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, and Western staples.  The food was plentiful and delicious, and we certainly made the most of the buffet.  You are also advised to check out the 'sweet' room, where the pastries and other desserts are kept, as well as the freshly made ice cream - yes, ice cream!  Our eldest daughter loved being able to have ice cream every day for breakfast, and there is a wonderful assortment of flavours.  Our only minor complaint was that some of the food will get rotated out in favour of other dishes during a 'longer' stay so you may miss out on some of your favourites.  We also dined at Table 8 (Chinese), and Edogin (Japanese) during our stay.  Both offer buffet meals, but outside of breakfast, we are not particularly big eaters, so we opted for a la carte.  Both establishments offer authentic meals, at a very reasonable price, noting that some dishes are more expensive than others.  Our view was that the meals were very good for 'foreign' attempts at these types of cuisine, but obviously do not compare to meals made in those countries - however, this is not a negative point.  The kids menu is consistent between all dining establishments (thankfully), and our daughter was happy with all the meals she had, which is saying a lot for a particularly fussy eater.  We enjoyed checking out the Mulia Deli for dessert on a few nights (pro tip: 50% off after 8pm), with more ice cream and pastries being consumed by us.  Towards the end of our stay, we made use of the complementary welcome drink at the Cascade Lounge on the lobby level.  This area has arguably the best view of the entire property, which an elevated vantage point towards the east.  Our next favourite area was on level 5, towards the Mulia Lake, which is very serene.Soleil is the more 'casual' dining space operated near the pools, which focuses more on mediterranean and pan-asian fare.  We were shocked and pleasantly surprised to have had the tastiest wood-fired pizza we have ever had, as well as Thai and Vietnamese dishes which absolutely rival dishes we have been lucky enough to have in both countries at their best restaurants and street markets.  The atmosphere was very relaxing, and we enjoyed having most of our lunches and dinners here.  Overall, we would consider Soleil to be the pick of all the restaurants.  In terms of facilities, the resort gym/fitness centre is well-stocked with new and high tech equipment, but sadly very underutilised by the guests.  I only ever saw 2-3 guests there during our entire stay.  There are a multitude of pools throughout the property.  The majority of guests favoured the Ocean Pool, which was well patroned, but never too busy.  We made good use of the swim up bar.  The ladies courtyard pool and the courtyard pool barely had anyone using them during our stay, and if you are after a more relaxed and quiet setting, these places may be for you.  In terms of food and beverage cost, we spent approximately AUD100 per day for 3 people on various things (lunches, dinners, in room dining, as well as drinks), and consider that this is excellent compared to other high-end resorts, and definitely cheaper than Australia for the quality.  Other places in Bali can be much cheaper for meals, but the Mulia Resort provides good consistency, variety, and safety that you can rely on.  Given the many options for flights to Bali from Australia, I think this hotel is exceptional in terms of value for money for a more luxurious stay, especially when compared to the competition, and what is actually provided.This was our first time ever going to Bali, and did not know what to expect, but the Mulia Resort certainly endeared itself to us.  We had a very relaxing time, with zero fuss, and we felt very well taken care of.  Our days were spent eating, swimming, and just generally having a great time.  We will absolutely be making a return trip in the near future, and can easily recommend it to anyone looking for an upmarket and relaxing stay.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
